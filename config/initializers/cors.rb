# NOTES TO MYSELF =>  Rails provides the cors.rb file specifically for defining our rules for cross-origin HTTP requests.
# The string after origins specifies which hosts will be allowed to make requests to your API.
# Your brand-new rails app probably comes with the string "example.com" there â€” change it to "*" to allow all hosts.
